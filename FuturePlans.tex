Throughout my Ph.D., I plan to investigate and seek a more advanced approach to supersymmetry. On the way to achieving this goal, I believe interacting with more people outside my research area is necessary. It means to those in the same profession and people in exotic fields, such as high-energy physics theorists, phenomenologists, and mathematicians. As a result, I decided to study abroad for my Ph.D. and post-doctoral studies because the population pool is considerably more diversified than in Korea.

Also, I believe that a considerable amount of experts can aid Ph.D. students in concentrating on their research. For example, if there is enough manpower, the Ph.D. students would not struggle with administrative processing or technological problems, such as maintaining server systems. The students can get more time to research, which helps their papers to be more insightful. In this environment, I firmly believe I can be a more competitive scholar since increased time for concentration on my topic can assist me in being more advanced in my research topics.
