\newcommand{\univ}{UCSB}

\newcommand{\susyucsb}{Supersymmetry \; Supersymmetry is the most intriguing concept for me because of its natural emergence from action and solves several important problems of SM. Throughout my master's coursework, my major topic was searching for R-Parity violating supersymmetry signals. Searching signals from supersymmetry models with enlarged datasets will be a stimulating experience. At UCSB, the UCSB CMS group has several strong supersymmetry groups, including professor Claudio Campagnari, Jeffery D. Richman, and David Stuart. I dream of joining this group and searching for several supersymmetry models, such as RPV, Stealth and MSSM. }

\newcommand{\leptonucsb}{Neutrino search \; Leptons are getting special due to their anomalies. Neutrinos especially fascinate me because of their ghost-like ability makes people hard to detect. I wish to encounter many unseen behaviors of neutrinos by studying them more precisely. }

\newcommand{\bphysicsucsb}{B physics \; Bottom quark is third generation quark, the most massive one in the table of down quark family. Since massive particles require more energy when created, the bottom quark can be related to new physics.}
