I pursue the discovery of new physics beyond the standard model(SM). SM has weaknesses that cannot account for some problems, such as why gravitation is weaker than others. Beyond SM models can explain why, and they can give inspiration for how to exploit gravity or metrics of our universe. Also, there are several problems that SM cannot explain. Despite the countless observations suggesting the incompleteness of SM, until recently, a direct signal for new physics candidates has not been found. I want to do the direct measurement of new physics signals using leptons. The reason for the choice is that recent research shows that the anomalies in leptons might lead to such physics. By investigating this abnormality, I firmly believe that we can find new physics underlying these cracks. This moment is the most thrilling time to search for new physics beyond the horizon because there are plenty of clues pointing to new physics lurking under anomalies.
